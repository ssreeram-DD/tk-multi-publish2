class PublishFilesPlugin(HookBaseClass):
    """
    Plugin for creating generic publishes in Shotgun.

    This plugin is typically configured to act upon files that are dragged and
    dropped into the publisher UI. It can also be used as a base class for
    other file-based publish plugins as it contains standard operations for
    validating and registering publishes with Shotgun.

    Once attached to a publish item, the plugin will key off of properties that
    are set on the item. These properties can be set via the collector or
    by subclasses prior to calling methods on this class.

    The only property that is required for the plugin to operate is the ``path``
    property. All of the properties and settings understood by the plugin are
    documented below:

        Item properties
        -------------

        path - The path to the file to be published.

        sequence_paths - If set, implies the "path" property represents a
            sequence of files (typically using a frame identifier such as %04d).
            This property should be a list of files on disk matching the "path".

        is_sequence - A boolean defining whether or not this item is a sequence of files.

        publish_dependencies - A list of files to include as dependencies when
            registering the publish. If the item's parent has been published,
            it's path will be appended to this list.

        Task settings
        -------------------

        publish_type - If set in the plugin settings dictionary, will be
            supplied to SG as the publish type when registering "path" as a new
            publish. This is required.

        publish_name_template - If set in the plugin settings dictionary, will be
            supplied to SG as the publish name when registering the new publish.
            If not available, will fall back to the ``path_info`` hook logic.

        publish_path_template - If set in the plugin settings dictionary, used to
            determine where "path" should be copied prior to publishing. If
            not specified, "path" will be published in place.

    This plugin will also set the following properties on the item which may be 
    useful for child items.

        publish_type - Shotgun PublishedFile instance type.

        publish_name - Shotgun PublishedFile instance name.

        publish_version - Shotgun PublishedFile instance version.

        publish_path - The location on disk the publish is copied to.

        sg_publish_data - The dictionary of publish information returned from
            the tk-core register_publish method.
